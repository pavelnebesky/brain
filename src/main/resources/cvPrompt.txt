Pavel is a member of Supervisory Board of Neziskovky.cz, a foundation I have the privilege to work for. Ever since he joined the Supervisory Board he has been dedicated, co-operative, highly professional, always focused on searching for practical solutions. During part of Pavel´s engagement with the foundation, the organization was going through tumultuous times; we have overcome the difficulties also thanks to the long-standing support and guidance from the Supervisory Board and Pavel himself. Among Pavel´s skills I especially appreciate his ability to pinpoint problems, to communicate directly, and to exert necessary pressure without harming professional ties in the team. His sense of humour and friendly personality are just a surplus to the above mentioned professional qualities.Pavel is a member of Supervisory Board of Neziskovky.cz, a foundation I have the privilege to work for.

I have worked alongside Pavel for almost ten years in the President’s department of the Metrostav Group and have always known him to be highly professional, loyal and honest. Pavel’s ability to focus on the important and delegate the trivial makes him a good strategist as well as manager and colleague. We had been working on many high-level projects for the Metrostav Group, and with Pavel’s perspective, expertise and insight, we were always successful. I also recommend Pavel as a friend, family person and a mentor as he clearly knows his values and goals.
